<p>Hi, my name is Francis Tran. I grew up in Orange County, specifically Fountain Valley. I attended La Quinta High School in Westminster. My hobbies are playing games, sightseeing, eating, coding, and dancing. My favorite genre of music is hiphop. I have a lot of cool ideas that I would like to express in the form of coding projects. It's satisfying to make my thoughts come to life!</p>
